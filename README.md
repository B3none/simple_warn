# simple_warn
This is the public version of "Potatoz" plugin called "Simple Warn". This plugin is quite basic really, it allows admins to warn players and easily check how many warnings a player has. Admins are also automatically notified when a player with any warnings joins the server. Last but not least, if a player gets 3 or more warnings in a single round, this player will get banned in 10 minutes with reason "S-WARN: Too many Warnings".
